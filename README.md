<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
<ol>
  <li>Fork this Repo</li>
  <li>Clone it down to your machine</li>
  <li>cd into the root of the project directory</li>
  <li>run npm install</li>
  <li>To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal to start the local server. You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like: Project is running at http://localhost:8080/.</li>
  <li>Go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to view the code running in the browser.</li>
  <li>Enter control + c in your terminal to stop the local server at any time.</li>
  <li>You will also need to clone down [this local api server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) outside of the Travel Fox directory, follow the installation instructions, and have it running in a separate tab in your terminal each time you run the client.</li>
</ol>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
## Context
__Me:__ I'm a student in the Front End program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). TravelFox is my solo final project for Mod 2, which means I have been a dev for just under 3 months!
__The project:__      
Travel Tracker is a solo assignment that serves as an end-of-mod assessment, so students can flex ðŸ’ª their skills and understanding. The goals for this project include:    
* Using _object-oriented programming_ to drive application design
* Working with an API to _get_ and _post_ data
* Create a _robust test suite_ to test all functionality

Other features I want to highlight:         
* Accessibility: app is fully _tabbable_, and scored high on both Lighthouse and Wave audits         
* Functions follow the single responsibility principle (SRP)     
* Clean, attractive design     
* Error handling: form validation, clear error and confirmation messaging        
* 3rd part library: I opted to use dayjs, which required independent study and testing
